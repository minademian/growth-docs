# Deployment

> Every time I ship to prod, I take 5 minutes to write:
> 1. What changed
> 2. Why it mattered
> 3. What came out of it
> It’s surprisingly helpful, especially when you get asked, “What did you do last quarter?”. During an outage? This is golden. Especially when you're the one causing the outage, lol. It happens.
> Bonus: I track pre, mid, and post-deploy notes (e.g. logs, follow-ups, rollout issues). Tiny effort, big clarity.
